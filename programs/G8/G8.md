# The MVPF of G8

In the early 2000s most of the German federal states reduced the length of the academic track high schools by one year
from 9 to 8 years. This is the so called G8. 
As this reform was not implemented simultaneously in all states, a Difference in Difference framework
can be used to analyze the effects of these reforms. 

## Relevant Effects on WTP and Government Budget:
*  University enrollment affected, which ultimately affects lifetime earnings and taxes paid. Marcus & Zambre (2019) find
a negative effect of -5.1 % on the enrollment.
* The number of teachers that need to be hired. This is not completely clear as G8 was not intended to reduce the hours spent in 
high school. Rather, the school years are compressed to teach the same content in 8 instead of 9 years by ading additional
hours in the afternoon.
Still, federal states expect that more teachers are required for G9.
* Students spend one year less in school and thus can start working / doing a apprenticeship / studying earlier and will ultimately 
join the labor force earlier and thus have up to one year more at their disposal where they can earn labor incomes and pay taxes
* Possibly effects on skill-acquisition, degree completion
