  test_score_tracking_effect <- estimates$test_score_tracking_effect

  # Piopiunik (2014) refers to literature that estimates the number of pisa points you earn per year of schooling.
  # On page 23, there are references to two values:
  # "To get an idea of the effect size, note that the
  # competency increase in one school year is on average about
  # 40 points in PISA 2003 (cf. Prenzel et al., 2005) and 25â€“30
  # points in PISA 2006 (see Prenzel et al., 2008, p. 59)"
  pisa_points_per_year <- 30

  # We can use this to translate the reform into years of schooling lost / gained and then calculate the effect on earnigns.
  # Obviously that's a rather rough approximation and results in about .43 school years lost due tracking.
  relative_earnings_effect <- test_score_tracking_effect / pisa_points_per_year * yearly_return_to_schooling

  # Alternatively specify whats the value of increasing test scores by a standard deviation:
  sd_pisa <- 90.5 # Piopiunik (2014) Table 2, 2003, Bavaria, non-Gym
  # return_to_one_sd_test_score <- ???
  # relative_earnings_effect <- test_score_tracking_effect / sd_pisa * return_to_one_sd_test_score


  # From Piopiunik (2014):
    # The new school law of April 2000 did not require an
    # immediate implementation of the reform, but rather
    # allowed middle schools to add a fifth and sixth grade
    # level within several years. This provided schools time to
    # hire additional teachers and to build additional buildings, if
    # necessary. The state-wide implementation of six-year
    # middle schools was complete by school year 2003/2004
    # -> Make 2003 the reform year.

  # This is unkown really. Overall number of school years did not chagne. Looking at the time series of spending on schools,
  # we see that spending per student went down for middle track and increased for the basic track. Since the number of students
  # in both tracks is roughly identical, and the increase in basic is larger than the decrease in middle, spending
  # increased after the reform. But is this due to the reform? Hard to say ... could also be transitional cost or something
  # else entirely. Assume no cost for now. (See the Figure 4 of Piopiunik (2014))
